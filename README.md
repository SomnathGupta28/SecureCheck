## 📦 Tech Stack

### 🧠 Core Languages
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and improved development experience
- **JavaScript** – Runtime execution (TypeScript transpiles to JS)
- **HTML5** – Structure and semantic layout
- **CSS3** – Styling with Tailwind CSS

### 🎨 Frontend Framework & Libraries
- **React 18** – Main UI framework (with Hooks)
- **React DOM** – DOM rendering for React
- **Lucide React** – Icon library (Shield, AlertTriangle, CheckCircle, etc.)

### ⚙️ Build & Tooling
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript Compiler** – Static type-checking
- **PostCSS** & **Autoprefixer** – CSS optimization and compatibility

### 💅 Styling Framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS
- **Tailwind Plugins** – For enhanced styling flexibility

### ✅ Code Quality & Linting
- **ESLint** – Linting for JS/TS
- **TypeScript ESLint** – Linting rules for TypeScript
- **React Hooks ESLint Plugin** – Best practices for React hooks
- **React Refresh ESLint Plugin** – Ensures hot reload compatibility

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Component-Based** – Reusable and modular React components
- **Custom Hooks** – Encapsulated logic for state and effects
- **Utility Functions** – Business logic decoupled from UI
- **TypeScript Interfaces** – Typed data structures

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ **Real-time URL Validation** using regex and the native `URL` API  
- ⚠️ **Security Analysis Engine**  
  - Regex pattern matching for phishing detection  
  - Domain reputation verification  
  - HTTPS protocol validation  
  - Risk scoring algorithm  
- 🔁 **Progressive Loading Animation**  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** (mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints)  
- 📊 **State Management** with `useState`

---

## 🌐 Browser APIs

- `URL API` – URL parsing and validation
- `DOM API` – Basic element interactions
- `Fetch API` – Placeholder for future API integrations

---

## 🛠 Development Environment

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime
- **NPM** – Package manager
- **Git** – Version control
- **ES6+** – Modern JavaScript features (async/await, destructuring, etc.)
